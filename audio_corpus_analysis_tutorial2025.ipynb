        "There is concept call _principle of parsimony_ or the idea behind that simpler models are more parsimonius than complex models, which stems from _Occam’s razor_. There are several statistical measures that assess the model fit and parsimoniousness ([Akaike Information Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) etc.). We are not entering into those calculations here but usually it is better to have a simple model and compromise the model accuracy a little bit than to gain few points in accuracy but having a complex model."
